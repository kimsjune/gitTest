# I wonder if this is really needed if the local branch is automatically called main.
git branch -M main

git remote add

# This creates a remote (also called origin) "main" from my local main branch 
git push -u origin main

# I can create and load a local branch where I can make changes
git checkout -b feature

# Check which branch I am on
git branch

# This pushes my local feature branch into remote (origin) with the same branch name, feature.
git push origin feature

# I can change branches, which changes the committed files.
git checkout main

# This README is only visible from feature branch, not main (both locally, and remotely (origin))
