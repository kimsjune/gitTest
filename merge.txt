# To avoid git push -f origin main to sync remote to local, I have to use git merge.
# push -f is not recommended when: 
  # repo is public, so other people might have pulled, which would break their connection with origin
  # commits might be deleted

# Step 1: create a new branch
git checkout -b dev

# Step 2: make changes and commit
git add . 
git commit -m "Development"

# Step 3: changes are saved to dev branch. Now go back to main before merging
git checkout main

# Step 4: merge
git merge dev

# Step 5: now the dev branch is redundant
git branch -d dev

# Step 5: push
git push origin main
